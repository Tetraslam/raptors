# Raptors ðŸ¦–

A powerful vulnerability scanner and dashboard that helps identify, analyze, and track system vulnerabilities in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time System Scanning**: Automatically detects open ports and running services on your system
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Integrates with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify potential security risks
- **AI-Powered Fix Suggestions**: Utilizes GPT-4 to provide structured, actionable fix recommendations
- **CVSS Scoring**: Calculates and categorizes vulnerabilities based on CVSS scores into Low, Medium, and Critical risks
- **Beautiful Dashboard**: Modern, responsive interface built with Shadcn/UI components
- **Report Management**: Stores and manages vulnerability reports using Supabase
- **Data Visualization**: Presents vulnerability data through intuitive and interactive visualizations

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_supabase_public_key
SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_supabase_private_key
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raptors.git
cd raptors
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Open the Raptors dashboard in your browser
2. Click "Start New Scan" to initiate a system vulnerability scan
3. Wait for the scan to complete - the system will:
   - Detect open ports and services
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Generate CVSS scores
   - Provide AI-powered fix suggestions
4. View the generated report in the dashboard with detailed visualizations
5. Access historical reports at any time through the dashboard interface

## API and Database Structure

### Supabase Schema

The database schema consists of the following main tables:

#### Services Table
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `port`: Integer - Port number of the detected service
- `name`: Text - Service name
- `version`: Text - Service version (optional)
- `protocol`: Text - Service protocol
- `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone

#### Vulnerabilities Table
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `cve_id`: Text - CVE identifier
- `description`: Text - Vulnerability description
- `cvss_score`: Float - CVSS score
- `risk_level`: Enum ('low', 'medium', 'critical')
- `affected_versions`: Text Array - List of affected versions
- `fix_suggestions`: Text - AI-generated fix suggestions
- `reference_urls`: Text Array - Reference URLs
- `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone

#### Scan Reports Table
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
- `timestamp`: Timestamp - Scan execution time
- `host`: Text - Scanned host
- `total_vulnerabilities`: Integer
- `risk_summary`: JSONB - Summary of vulnerabilities by risk level
- `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone

Junction tables `scan_report_services` and `scan_report_vulnerabilities` maintain many-to-many relationships between scan reports and their associated services/vulnerabilities.
